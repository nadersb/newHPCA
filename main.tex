\section{Conclusions}


% This document provides instructions for submitting papers to the 25th
% International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), 2019.  In an
% effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of
% fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all submissions
% to HPCA 2019 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed
% below. Submissions that violate these instructions may not be reviewed,
% at the discretion of the program chairs, in order to maintain a review
% process that is fair to all potential authors.


% An example file (formatted using the HPCA'19 submission format) that
% contains the formatting guidelines can be downloaded from the 
% \href{http://hpca2019.seas.gwu.edu/}{HPCA webpage}.  The content of this
% document mirrors the submission instructions that appear on that
% page.  The link to the HotCRP submission site also appears on the HPCA
% webpage.

% All questions regarding paper formatting and submission should be directed
% to the program co-chairs using the email address hpca19@cs.utah.edu.

% \subsection{Format Highlights}
% Note that there are several notices for paper format:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Paper must be submitted in printable PDF format.
% \item Text must be in a minimum 10pt ({\bf not} 9pt) font.
% \item Papers must be at most 11 pages, not including references. 
% \item No page limit for references.
% \item The references must include complete author lists (no {\em et al.}).
% \end{itemize}


% \subsection{Paper Evaluation Objectives}
% The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on
% its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate.
% We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations
% for evaluation --- while papers that build on significant past work
% with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with
% less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged.
% Given the wide range of topics covered by HPCA, every effort will be
% made to find expert reviewers.

% \subsection{Optional Second PDF for Resubmitted Papers}

% For submissions that were previously submitted to other conferences,
% we strongly encourage authors to take into account feedback received
% from previous reviews.  There is a reasonable probability that an
% HPCA-25 submission may be assigned to reviewers that have seen earlier
% versions of the same paper.  
% \hl{To ease the reviewing burden, and to help authors highlight the
% improvements to their paper, authors can optionally submit a second
% pdf that highlights the major changes to their work, relative to prior
% submissions.}
% We anticipate that this process will hold authors and reviewers more
% accountable, and perhaps help reduce any pre-conceived bias that a
% reviewer may have against the paper.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The second pdf will not be made visible to reviewers by default.  If a reviewer believes they have reviewed an earlier version of the paper, they will email the PC Chairs and ask for the second pdf.
% \item The second pdf can not introduce new content.  It must be identical to the HPCA-25 submission, but can use color to highlight specific text/captions that are different from prior versions of the paper.  A 100-word appendix may be included to summarize and provide context for the major changes.
% \item In latex, text can be highlighted using \hl{ \textbackslash hl\{...\}, as has been done here.}  The submission template already includes the necessary latex packages color and soul.  To remove the highlight, simply set the highlight color to white (example in the latex template).
% \item Authors have the flexibility to decide what significant changes they want to highlight to a reviewer.  Obviously, authors will want to draw attention to all prior show-stopping concerns that have been addressed in the new submission.
% \item The second pdf upload deadline is also at 11:59pm EDT on Friday August 3rd.  For those planning on working on their paper until the last minute, a one hour grace period is being offered.
% \item In case of any questions about this new policy, please feel free to email the PC chairs at: \\ hpca19@cs.utah.edu.
% \end{itemize}


% \section{Paper Preparation Instructions}

% \subsection{Paper Formatting}

% Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a
% {\bf maximum of 11 pages} of single-spaced two-column text, {\bf not
%   including references}.  You may include any number of pages for
% references, but see below for more instructions.  If you are using
% \LaTeX~\cite{lamport94} to typeset your paper, then we suggest that
% you use the template here:
% \href{http://hpca2019.seas.gwu.edu//hpca25-latex-template.tar.gz}{\LaTeX~Template}. This
% document was prepared with that template.  If you use a different
% software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the
% guidelines given in Table~\ref{table:formatting}.

% \begin{scriptsize}
% \begin{table}[h!]

% \end{scriptsize}

% \textbf{Please ensure that you include page numbers with your
% submission}. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different
% parts of your paper when they provide comments.

% Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the
% title page, similar to
% \href{http://hpca2019.seas.gwu.edu/hpca25_sample.pdf}{this one},
% which contains the submission number and the notice of
% confidentiality.  If using the template, just replace XXX with your
% submission number.

% \subsection{Content}

% %\noindent\textbf{\sout{Author List.}} Reviewing will be double blind;
% therefore, please do not include any author names on any submitted
% documents except in the space provided on the submission form.  You must
% also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the
% authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior
% work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the
% bibliography.  For example, if you are building on {\em your own} prior
% work in the papers \cite{nicepaper1,nicepaper2,nicepaper3}, you would say
% something like: ``While the authors of
% \cite{nicepaper1,nicepaper2,nicepaper3} did X, Y, and Z, this paper
% additionally does W, and is therefore much better."  Do NOT omit or
% anonymize references for blind review.  There is one exception to this: for
% your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL or workshops without archived
% proceedings, as discussed later in this document.

% \noindent\textbf{Figures and Tables.} Ensure that the figures and tables
% are legible.  Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main
% text.  Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use
% colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly
% distinguishable in gray-scale.

% \noindent\textbf{References.}  There is no length limit for references.
% {\bf Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper.  Papers
% not meeting this requirement will be rejected.} Authors of NSF proposals
% should be familiar with this requirement. Knowing all authors of related
% work will help find the best reviewers. Since there is no length limit
% for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space
% here.

% \section{Paper Submission Instructions}

% \subsection{Guidelines for Determining Authorship}


% IEEE guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a {\bf
%   substantial intellectual contribution}. It is assumed that all
% authors have had a significant role in the creation of an article that
% bears their names. In particular, the authorship credit must be
% reserved only for individuals who have met each of the following
% conditions:

% \begin{enumerate}

% \item Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical
%   development, system or experimental design, prototype development,
%   and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the
%   work contained in the article;

% \item Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising
%   it for intellectual content; and

% \item Approved the final version of the article as accepted for
%   publication, including references.

% \end{enumerate}

% A detailed description of the IEEE authorship guidelines and
% responsibilities is available
% \href{https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Section821.html}{here}.
% Per these guidelines, it is not acceptable to award {\em honorary }
% authorship or {\em gift} authorship. Please keep these guidelines in
% mind while determining the author list of your paper.


% \subsection{Declaring Authors}

% Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors
% once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program co-chairs,
% since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for
% reviewer assignment.


% \subsection{Areas and Topics}

% Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as
% well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If
% you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of HPCA, please
% check with the program chair -- HPCA is a broad, multidisciplinary
% conference and encourages new topics.

% \subsection{Declaring Conflicts of Interest}

% Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site.
% Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers.
% If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes
% a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to
% abuse or ``game'' the review system, the paper may be rejected.

% Pease declare a conflict of interest (COI) with the following people for any author of your paper:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students,
%       and post-doctoral advisees, forever.
% \item Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent,
%       forever (if they might be potential reviewers).
% \item People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including
% \begin{itemize}
% \item co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers.
% \item co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals.
% \item funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers
%       whom you fund.
% \end{itemize}
% \item People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the
% last FIVE years.
% \item Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend
% to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar
% with the relationship.
% \end{enumerate}

% ``Service'' collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional
% organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting
% tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest.
% Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with
% no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a
% conflict among the authors of the different projects.

% On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with
% whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration
% which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal.
% Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them.
% Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a
% reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or
% related to those in your paper.  The PC Chair may contact co-authors
% to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

% We hope to draw most reviewers from the PC and the ERC, but others from the
% community may also write reviews.  Please declare all your conflicts (not
% just restricted to the PC and ERC).  When in doubt, contact the program
% co-chairs.

% \subsection{Concurrent Submissions and Workshops}

% By submitting a manuscript to HPCA'19, the authors guarantee that the
% manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in
% a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or the archived
% proceedings of a workshop (e.g., in the ACM digital library) -- see
% exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains
% significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be
% under review for any other conference or journal or an archived proceedings
% of a workshop during the HPCA'19 review period. Violation of any of these
% conditions will lead to rejection.

% The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors' own papers
% in (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital
% library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the
% archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL where there is an
% explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference
% submissions.  In all such cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the above
% work to preserve author anonymity. This information must, however, be provided
% on the submission form -- the PC chairs will make this information available to
% reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review.  As always, if you
% are in doubt, it is best to contact the program co-chairs.
        
% Authors are not barred from uploading their papers to arxiv and similar sites.
% But please note that such efforts may compromise the double-blind review
% process, so please exercise care when discussing your submission in public
% forums.  On a related note, unrefereed on-line pre-prints are not assumed to
% constitute "prior work" -- in other words, reviewers cannot penalize an HPCA
% submission because it does not cite a pre-print with limited visibility.


% Finally, we also note that the IEEE Plagiarism Guidelines \href{http://www.ieee.org/publications\_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html}{IEEE Plagiarism Guidelines} covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or
% one's own work.
