To best of our knowledge, this is first work to compare RISC-V with its popular proprietary counterparts (ARM and MIPS). We used state-of-art simulation and emulation frameworks: \textit{qemu} for program analysis and \textit{gem5} for microarchitectural simulations. We also present concrete cases where RISC-V clearly falls behind compared to ARM, MIPS ISAs and what addendum could possibly make it competitive. To our surprise, we also stumbled upon cases where RISC-V is better than proprietary ISAs. Overarching goal of our exploration is to enable RISC-V designers so that they can augment their designs and be able to close the gap with other state-of-art ISAs.
