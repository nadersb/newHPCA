RISC-V is an emerging open-source software and hardware ecosystem that has gained in popularity in both industry and academia [2, 11]. At the heart of the ecosystem, the RISC-V ISA is designed to be open, simple, extensible, and free to use. The RISC-V software tool chain includes open-source compilers (e.g., GNU/GCC and LLVM), a full Linux port, a GNU/GDB debugger, verification tools, and simulators. On the hardware side, several RISC-V prototypes (e.g., Celerity [4]) have been published. The rapid growth of the RISC-V ecosystem enables computer architects to quickly leverage RISC-V in their research.
